### Advantages of RSC:

- Load faster - Don't have to wait for the JavaScript to load
- Smaller client bundle size
- SEO friendly
- Access to resources the client can't access
- Hide sensitive data from the client
- More secure against XSS attacks
- Improved developer experience

### Just like with anything else, there are also disadvantages:

- Not as interactive
- No component state. We can not use the `useState` hook.
- No component lifecycle methods. We can not use the `useEffect` hook.
